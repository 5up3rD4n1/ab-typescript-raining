# Tasks

## Objects

1. Investigate how to get all keys of an object
2. Create a code that takes an object and transforms all its keys to uppercase
   1. For instance `{hello: 1}` should result into `{HELLO: 1}`

- name
- age
- county
- gender (F/M only)
- address (object)
  - line1
  - city
  - zipCode

1. Use array functions to filter the array with females only (tinder)
2. Use array functions to map the array and increase age by 2 years
3. Use array functions to remove the address key from every record

## Functions

1. Create a function that receives a list of people and another function that decides if the person should be filter out or not
   1. Create multiple filtering (criteria) functions to test. Examples:
      1. Filter out people older than 21
